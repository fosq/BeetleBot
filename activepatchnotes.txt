__**OCTOBER 12TH**__
- 13.20 brought ambitious reworks and a large amount of buffs to ensure a multitude of new comps could have their chance in the meta. But we missed the mark, overshooting the power of the reworked Multicaster comp and failing to nerf Nilah’s power ceiling which became higher with the Nilah / Sejuani comp’s discovery, and nerfs to other meta comps. And here we are a bit over 24 hours later with a few solves to apply.
